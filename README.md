# Asg-4-Pandas

**Purpose**
The purpose of this project is to perform data analysis on two datasets: Petal_Data and Sepal_Data. The code merges these datasets, converts string columns to numeric values, and calculates various statistical measures such as correlation, average, median, and standard deviation.

**Input**
Petal_Data.csv: A CSV file containing data related to petal measurements.
Sepal_Data.csv: A CSV file containing data related to sepal measurements.

**Output**
Combined DataFrame: The merged dataset containing both petal and sepal data.
Correlation Matrix: A matrix showing the correlation between different variables.
Average Values: The mean of each variable in the combined dataset.
Median Values: The median of each variable in the combined dataset.
Standard Deviation: The standard deviation of each variable in the combined dataset.
